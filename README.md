# Wafer Status Classification Project

**Background**
---

<img src="https://www.semiconductorforu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/silicon-wafer.jpg">

In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. Monitoring working conditions of these wafers present its challenges of having additional resources required for manual monitoring with insights and decisions that need to be made quickly for replacing wafers that are not in good working conndition when required. Using IIOT (Industrial Internet of Things) helps to overcome this challenge through a collection of real-time data from multiple sensors. 

Thus, the main goal of this project is to design a machine learning model that predicts whether a wafer is in a good working condition or not based on inputs from 590 different sensors for every wafer. The quality of wafer sensors can be classified into two different categories: -1 for "good wafer" and +1 for "bad wafer".

Dataset is provided in .csv format by client under <b>Training_Batch_Files</b> folder for model training, while dataset under <b>Prediction_Batch_Files</b> folder will be used for predicting quality of wafer sensors.

In addition, schema of datasets for training and prediction is provided in .json format by the client for storing seperate csv files into a single MySQL database.

**Code and Resources Used**

**Project Architecture Summary**
---
The following points below summarizes the structure for running this project:
1. Validating the quality of batch files source (<b>Training_Batch_Files</b> folder) based on a set of customized validation rules for model training.
2. Inserting good quality training data from batch files into MySQL database, which is hosted on Heroku platform.
3. Export compiled data from previous step into a single .csv file in <b>Training_Data_FromDB</b> folder for data preprocessing.
4. Preprocess data using various feature engineering techniques, while performing initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Note that results from certain stages of data preprocessing are saved in <b>Intermediate_Train_Results</b> folder for reference.
5. Perform resampling using <b>SMOTETomek</b> on the training dataset seperately after data preprocessing.
6. The following set of configurations are also tested for various number of features selected from using <b>F-classification</b> on various models along with hyperparameter tuning:
- Resampling vs No resampling
- Clustering vs No clustering
7. Results from previous steps are stored in .csv file named as <b>"Model_results_by_num_features.csv"</b>
8. Best model is identified from a set of evaluation criteria and the best model is retrained on the entire dataset before saving it into .pkl file under <b>Saved_Models</b> folder.
9. Validating the quality of batch files source (<b>Prediction_Batch_Files</b> folder) based on a set of customized validation rules for model prediction.
10. Inserting good quality prediction data from batch files into MySQL database.
11. Export compiled data from previous step into a single .csv file in <b>Prediction_Data_FromDB</b> folder for data preprocessing.
12. Preprocess data using the same feature engineering techniques identified in Step 4.
13. Perform either resampling or clustering or both on the preprocessed data from previous step based on configurations of best model identified from step 8.
14. Perform model prediction using best models saved from step 8 and results from model prediction are saved into <b>Intermediate_Pred_Results</b> folder.

Note that all steps mentioned above have been logged accordingly for future reference and easy maintenance, which are stored in <b>Training_Logs</b> and <b>Prediction_Logs</b> folders. Any bad quality data identified for model training and model prediction will be archived accordingly in <b>Archive_Training_Data</b> and <b>Archive_Prediction_Data</b> folders.

The following sections below explains the three main approaches that can be used for model deployment in this project:
1. <b>Cloud Platform (Heroku)</b>
2. <b>Local system</b>
3. <b>Docker</b>

**Project Instructions (Heroku)**
---
<b> For deploying models onto Heroku platform, the following additional files are essential</b>:
- Procfile
- requirements.txt
- setup.sh

<b>Note that deploying models onto other cloud platforms like GCP, AWS or Azure may have different additionnal files required.</b>

For replicating the steps required for running this project on your own Heroku account, the following steps are required:
1. Clone this github repository into your local machine system or your own Github account if available.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34255556/160223555-388eb56f-7ca5-4d40-88ca-ad80b1638599.png" width="600" height="200">

2. Delete files stored inside Training_Logs and Prediction_Logs folder, while creating a dummy.txt file inside both folders respectively. This is to ensure both directories exist when the model is deployed into Heroku.

4. Go to "Resources" tab and search for ClearDB MySQL in the add-ons search bar.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34255556/160224064-35295bf6-3170-447a-8eae-47c6721cf8f0.png" width="600" height="200">

5. Select the ClearDB MySQL add-on and select the relevant pricing plan. (Note that I select Punch plan, which currently cost about $9.99 per month to increase storage capacity for this project.)

6. Add an additional Python file named as DBConnectionSetup.py that contains the following Python code structure: 
```
  logins = {"host": <host_name>, 
            "user": <user_name>, 
            "password": <password>, 
            "dbname": <default_Heroku_database_name>}
```
- For security reasons, this file needs to be stored in private. I've also included a video reference link below for clear instructions on setup ClearDB MySQL for Heroku.

<b>Important Note: Using "free" dynos on Heroku app only allows the app to run for a maximum of 30 minutes. Since the model training and prediction process takes a long time, consider changing the dynos type to "hobby" for unlimited time, which cost about $7 per month per dyno. You may also consider changing the dynos type to Standard 1X/2X for enhanced app performance.</b>

**Project Findings**
---

### 1. Overall confusion matrix

The following image below summarizes the confusion matrix from the final model trained for predicting status of wafers:

![Overall_Confusion_Matrix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34255556/163699138-a8986e96-8d38-4921-950a-62ce43f57b26.png)

From the image above, the classification model performs better for status of wafers in bad condition (1) with less false negatives (6 samples), as compared to false positives (155 samples). Given that the model evaluation criteria emphasize the costly impact of having false negatives, the current classification model is optimized to improve recall score, instead of precision score.
  
### 2. Best classification model configuration

The following information below summarizes the configuration of the best model identified in this project:

  - <b>Best model class identified</b>: Extra Trees Classifier

  - <b>Best model hyperparameters</b>: {'bootstrap': False, 'ccp_alpha': 0.021602078477013453, 'class_weight': 'balanced_subsample', 'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features': 'auto', 'max_leaf_nodes': None, 'max_samples': None, 'min_impurity_decrease': 0.0, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_weight_fraction_leaf': 0.0, 'n_estimators': 115, 'n_jobs': None, 'oob_score': False, 'random_state': 42, 'verbose': 0, 'warm_start': False}

  - <b>Number of features selected</b>: 10

  - <b>List of features selected</b>: ['Sensor56', 'Sensor101', 'Sensor104', 'Sensor112', 'Sensor130', 'Sensor153', 'Sensor184', 'Sensor337', 'Sensor346', 'Sensor424']

  - <b>Resampling</b>: No
  
  - <b>Clustering</b>: No

Note that the results above may differ for every instance of project implementation.

### 3. Summary of model evaluation metrics from best classification model

The following information below summarizes the evaluation metrics from the best model identified in this project: 

  - <b>Matthews Correlation Coefficient (Train-val set)</b>: 0.3330
  - <b>Matthews Correlation Coefficient (Test set)</b>: 0.2921
  
  - <b>F2-score (Train-val set)</b>: 0.6549
  - <b>F2-score (Test set)</b>: 0.6476

Note that the results above may differ for every instance of project implementation.

### 4. Learning Curve Analysis
  
![Learning_Curve_Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34255556/163699431-659f64dd-8c00-4a51-9570-1082f3542971.png)

From the diagram above, the gap between train and test F2 scores (from 5-fold cross validation) gradually decreases as number of training sample size increases. However, the gap between both scores still remain greater than 15% difference, which indicates that more training sample size can be collected to further reduce model overfitting.
